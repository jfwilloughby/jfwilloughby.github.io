I am a native Atlantan and a graduate of the Westminster Schools.  I attended Southern Methodist University in Texas, graduating with a BS in Computer Engineering in 2011. I returned to the Atlanta area, was accepted into the Gwinnett County Police Academy. I graduated to the force in 2013.  I learned that police field work was not my calling.  I sought a position with Business Process Management Solutions (BPMS), was hired in 2013, and worked there for 8 months. BPMS was acquired by Ernst and Young (EY) and I was retained by EY, advancing to analyst, and stayed with them for the next 2 years. In 2017, I began the Master of Analytics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  I anticipate graduating with the degree in spring of 2019.

I became interested in analytics through my love of sports.  In sports a greater and greater wealth of data is used to assess teams, individual players, coaches and their possible trajectories.  I would like to work in an organization in which I can examine relevant data, help make sense of it, and help the organization to generate useful insights into the problems that need to be addressed.

Interests and hobbies of mine include driving for UBER,  the Atlanta Hawks, Falcons, Braves, and United and journaling using a fountain pen. The physical art of writing has dwindled.  I have enjoyed learning about different styles of pen and paper and I practice the craft of handwriting daily.  I have found that letter writing to friends and family is a significant means of communication.

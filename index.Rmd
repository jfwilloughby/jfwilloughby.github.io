I graduated from Southern Methodist University with a MS in Computer Engineering in 2011. I returned to the Atlanta area and graduated from the Gwinnett County Police Academy. I worked at Business Process Management Solutions(BPMS) for 8 months before they were acquired by Ernst and Young(EY). I then worked at EY for 2 years. In 2018 I began the Master of Analytics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I expect to graduate in the spring of 2019.

I became interested in analytics through sports and that lead me to see how it is used everywhere. The ways data is used to inform people and companies is fascinating. The amount of data being generated is enormous and people need to understand when their personal data is being used and what it is being used for. It is also important to handle this data carefully. 

I got my first fountain pen while I was attending SMU. Since then it has been a journey through the world of stationary. There is a pen, ink, and paper combination for anyone and I have enjoyed trying the different combinations to find mine.

I graduated from Southern Methodist University with a MS in Computer Engineering in 2011. In 2018 I began the Master Of Analytics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I expect to graduate in the spring of 2019.

I am a huge fan of Atlanta sports. I am an avid basketball fan. This includes analysis of current team tactics, the identification of prospects, and analyzing how to maximize the production of present players.
